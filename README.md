# American Sign Language Recognition <br> Using Machine Learning
## Richard Avery Boutin & Christopher Iverson
### Recognize each letter in the American Sign Language Alphabet using machine learning. 

Hearing and speech impairment are increasingly prevalent health conditions in society that can greatly affect technological accessibility. Our primary goal is to train a machine learning model, using neural networks, to recognize each character in the American Sign Language alphabet.
